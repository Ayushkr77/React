# React Learning Journey 🧠⚛️

This repository documents my progress and key concepts learned while studying React. It includes foundational topics, hands-on mini-projects, and essential React hooks that form the backbone of modern React development.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🧱 1. React Tutorial for Beginners  
- Introduction to React.
- Understanding JSX, components, and the React workflow.

### 🃏 2. Card Components  
- Creating reusable UI blocks.
- Using props to pass dynamic content to cards.

### 🎨 3. Adding CSS Styles  
- Inline styles, CSS modules, and external stylesheets in React.

### 📧 4. Props  
- Passing data to components using props.  
- **Note**: `defaultProps` are deprecated in React 19+.

### ❓ 5. Conditional Rendering  
- Rendering elements based on logic using `if`, `&&`, ternary operator, etc.

### 📃 6. Rendering Lists  
- Displaying dynamic lists using `map()` function.
- Assigning unique `key` props for performance.

### 👆 7. Handling Click Events  
- Adding interactivity using `onClick` event handlers.

### 🎣 8. `useState()` Hook  
- Declaring and updating component state.
- Initializing primitive and complex states.

### 🚦 9. `onChange` Event Handler  
- Capturing user input from form elements like `<input>` or `<textarea>`.

### 🖌 10. Color Picker App  
- A simple project demonstrating state updates and UI reflection.

### 🔄 11. Updater Functions in `useState`  
- Using functional updates for accurate state changes based on previous state.

### 🚗 12. Updating Objects in State  
- Spreading and immutably updating nested properties in objects.

### 🍎 13. Updating Arrays in State  
- Adding, removing, and modifying items in arrays using `setState`.

### 🚘 14. Updating Array of Objects in State  
- Real-world scenarios like to-do apps and cart management.
- Updating individual items based on `id`.

### ☝ 15. To-Do List App  
- Project combining rendering lists, events, and state updates.

### 🌟 16. `useEffect()` Hook  
- Running side effects like data fetching, timers, and subscriptions.
- Cleanup with return functions.

### 🕒 17. Digital Clock App  
- Using `useEffect` with `setInterval` to update time dynamically.

### 🧗‍♂️ 18. `useContext()` Hook  
- Avoiding prop drilling by sharing state across deeply nested components.

### 🗳️ 19. `useRef()` Hook  
- Referencing DOM elements.
- Holding mutable values across renders without re-rendering.

### ⏱ 20. Stopwatch App  
- Final mini-project implementing `useRef`, `useEffect`, and `useState`.

## 💡 Highlights

- Built several mini-projects to reinforce learning.
- Gained hands-on experience with React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useRef`).
- Learned how to structure components, manage state, handle user interactions, and use context effectively.
