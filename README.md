## 📁 Folder Structure

### 🔹 `react-app/`
Covers all **fundamental React topics**, including components, props, state, effects, DOM interactions, and mini-projects.

### 🔹 `react-app-2/`
Covers:
- **Routing** using `react-router-dom`
- **Basics of Custom Hooks**
- **Additional Hooks** like `useReducer`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo`
- **React Forms** (Controlled and Uncontrolled Components)

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 📂 `react-app/`

#### 🧱 1. React Tutorial for Beginners
- Introduction to React.
- Understanding JSX, components, and the React workflow.

#### 🃏 2. Card Components
- Creating reusable UI blocks.
- Using props to pass dynamic content to cards.

#### 🎨 3. Adding CSS Styles
- Inline styles, CSS modules, and external stylesheets in React.

#### 📧 4. Props
- Passing data to components using props.
- _Note: `defaultProps` are deprecated in React 19+._

#### ❓ 5. Conditional Rendering
- Rendering elements based on logic using `if`, `&&`, ternary operators, etc.

#### 📃 6. Rendering Lists
- Displaying dynamic lists using `map()` function.
- Assigning unique key props for performance.

#### 👆 7. Handling Click Events
- Adding interactivity using `onClick` event handlers.

#### 🎣 8. `useState()` Hook
- Declaring and updating component state.
- Initializing primitive and complex states.

#### 🚦 9. `onChange` Event Handler
- Capturing user input from form elements like `<input>` or `<textarea>`.

#### 🖌 10. Color Picker App
- A simple project demonstrating state updates and UI reflection.

#### 🔄 11. Updater Functions in `useState`
- Using functional updates for accurate state changes based on previous state.

#### 🚗 12. Updating Objects in State
- Spreading and immutably updating nested properties in objects.

#### 🍎 13. Updating Arrays in State
- Adding, removing, and modifying items in arrays using `setState`.

#### 🚘 14. Updating Array of Objects in State
- Real-world scenarios like to-do apps and cart management.
- Updating individual items based on `id`.

#### ☝ 15. To-Do List App
- Project combining rendering lists, events, and state updates.

#### 🌟 16. `useEffect()` Hook
- Running side effects like data fetching, timers, and subscriptions.
- Cleanup with return functions.

#### 🕒 17. Digital Clock App
- Using `useEffect` with `setInterval` to update time dynamically.

#### 🧗‍♂️ 18. `useContext()` Hook
- Avoiding prop drilling by sharing state across deeply nested components.

#### 🗳️ 19. `useRef()` Hook
- Referencing DOM elements.
- Holding mutable values across renders without re-rendering.

#### ⏱ 20. Stopwatch App
- Final mini-project implementing `useRef`, `useEffect`, and `useState`.

### 📂 `react-app-2/`

#### 🧩 21. Routing with `react-router-dom`
- Navigating between pages using `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Link`.

#### 🛠️ 22. Custom Hooks (Basics)
- Creating reusable hooks to abstract logic.

#### 🔁 23. `useReducer()` Hook
- Handling complex state logic with reducer functions and dispatch.

#### ⚡ 24. `useCallback()` Hook
- Preventing unnecessary re-renders by memoizing functions.

#### 💭 25. `useMemo()` Hook
- Optimizing performance by memoizing computed values.

#### 📝 26. React Forms
- **Controlled Components** using `useState`
- **Uncontrolled Components** using `useRef`

---

## 💡 Highlights

- Built several mini-projects to reinforce learning.
- Gained hands-on experience with core React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useRef`).
- Covered advanced hooks like `useReducer`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo`.
- Implemented React forms using both controlled and uncontrolled approaches.
- Learned routing and custom hook patterns.

---

## 🔗 Tech Stack

- **React**
- **JavaScript**
- **HTML & CSS**

---

## 🛠️ Next Steps

- Dive deeper into advanced React patterns (e.g., compound components, HOCs).
- Expand routing knowledge with nested routes, route guards, and lazy loading.
- Explore state management libraries:
  - **Redux**
  - **Zustand**
  - **Recoil** ✅ *(Included for upcoming learning)*
- Integrate third-party form libraries like Formik or React Hook Form.
- Start building full-fledged React projects with backend integration and authentication.
